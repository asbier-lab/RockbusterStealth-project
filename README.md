## Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a global movie rental company transitioning from physical stores to online streaming.  
As a data analyst in the Business Intelligence (BI) department, I explored their PostgreSQL database to extract insights on revenue, rental behavior, and customer distribution.

## Key Questions & Objectives
The management board asked:
- Which movies contributed the most or least to revenue?
- What was the average rental duration for all films?
- Which countries are Rockbuster’s customers based in?
- Who are high-value customers?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Tools & Skills
**Tools:** PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, Tableau, Excel  
**Skills:** Data extraction, joins, aggregations, subqueries, data cleaning, data storytelling, visualization

## Deliverables
- SQL queries answering key business questions  
- Summary reports visualized in Tableau  
- Presentation of findings for management
